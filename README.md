# rockPaperScissors

My own take on the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game that we all know and love.

This was built based on "The Odin Project" curriculum utilizing HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

What I learned:

[1] How to adequately use event listeners.
[2] How to manipulate the DOM by integrating HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
[3] More animation techniques using CSS and JavaScript.
